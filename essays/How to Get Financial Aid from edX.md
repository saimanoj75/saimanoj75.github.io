edX are home to many of the web’s highest quality courses. Working with top universities and, on occasion, companies, they help create content designed to build skills and knowledge. With most of their courses priced between $40 and $79, their offerings are competitively priced.

Being inexpensive, however, doesn’t necessarily mean these courses are affordable. Indeed, that there’s a price tag at all means that some learners are precluded from enrolling. Thankfully, that doesn’t need to be the case.edX have generous Financial Aid programs so that those who need assistance can enroll.

## What is Financial Aid?

Financial Aid provides learners the ability to enroll in a paid course either for free or at a steep discount. To qualify, you’ll need to demonstrate that paying course fees would cause economic hardship. This means that you may qualify even if you’re able to pay the course fees at their full list price.

Financial Aid is available on most courses. Receiving Financial Aid allows you to earn a Verified Certificate. Contrast this to taking a course for free on an audit track where you receive no certificate on completion.

Coursera grants access to courses for which you receive Financial Aid for free. edX on the other hand offers a discount that can be as high as 90% off the list price of the course.

## What about Financial Aid for Specializations and MicroMasters?

Coursera Specializations and edX MicroMasters are names given to a series of courses. When you apply for Financial Aid to these programs, you must apply once for each course in the series. 

For example, if a Coursera Specialization includes five courses, you’ll need to submit an application five separate times. If a edX MicroMasters has 7 courses, you’ll need to eventually submit 7 applications.

## Getting started with your application

Applying to Financial Aid requires that you have an account first. You’ll need an edX account to apply for Financial Aid for a course on edX, a Coursera account for a Coursera course. Creating an account on either platform is easy and free, much like signing up for any other digital service.

To see the Financial Aid form on Coursera, you may need to log in on a computer. The Financial Aid application may not be available on mobile devices (like a smartphone or tablet).
