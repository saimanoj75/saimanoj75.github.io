<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/degree_difficulty.jpg">*Codeing: If you're a technical lead, you need to be coding.*

Today, there are more types of technical roles than ever before and continued proliferation of new languages, frameworks, and technologies. Technical employees that want to get ahead should routinely test and refine their skills. To that end, I’ve put together the following list of platforms where you can level up your skills for any number of roles, from data science to developer operations.

## HACKER EARTH (BEGINNER TO ADVANCED)

Hacker Earth Is A Popular Coding Platform That Features Over 8000+ Questions, 2000+ Challenges, And 1000+ Hackathons. it  helps organisations with their technical hiring needs. HackerEarth is used by organizations for technical skill assessment and remote video interviewing. In addition to that HackerEarth also has a community and since inception built a base of 4M+ developers.

## HACKER RANK (BEGINNER TO ADVANCED)

HackerRank has a large collection of coding challenges tailored towards algorithms and data structures, along with interview prep material, a discussion board for each challenge, and a list of top user solutions. They have challenges for other topics as well as functional programming, AI, Shell, SQL, and more.

## CODE CHEF (All Levels)

Codechef Is A Platform To Help Programmers Elevate Their Skills In The World Of Algorithms, Programming, And Contests. They Also Host 3 Contests Each Month Where Prizes Are Given.

## CODING GAME (ALL LEVELS)

Codegame, Our Goal Is To Let Programmers Keep On Improving Their Coding Skills By Solving The World's Most Challenging Problems, Learn New Concepts.

## CODEPEN CHALLENGES (ALL LEVELS)

Codepen Is An Online Community For Testing And Showcasing User-created Html, Css, And Javascript Code Snippets.

## TOP CODER (BEGINNER TO ADVANCED)

Topcoder Is For Competitive Programming Online. It Provides A List Of Algorithmic Challenges.

## LEET CODE (BEGINNER TO ADVANCED)

Leet Code has a collection of some of the best algorithm challenges online today. The topics they cover require knowledge of data structures such as binary trees, heaps, linked lists, etc., which is why their challenges are a bit more advanced than some other websites — but the challenges are great if used when preparing for a software engineering interview.

They also have a Mock Interview section that is specifically for job interview preparation, they host their own coding contests, and they have a great discussion board where people talk about interview questions, jobs, compensation, and other topics related to engineering.

## CODE FORCES

Codeforces is now probably the top competitive programming website (where a few years ago TopCoder was where most competitive programmers spent their time). There are problems that you can solve online to practice, but there’s no online editor. Rather, you write your solution in your own editor and then upload it to their system which then tests your code against a suite of test cases.

They also frequently hold contests where the best competitive programmers take part in.
